# A dashboard is a collection of visualizations that are organized into sections.
# Because they allow filtering and other adjustments, they function as a dynamic presentation layer for your data analytics.

  - title: How big is Pluto, anyway?
    description: Pluto's moons are quite massive and some astronomers suggest to call Pluto-Charon a binary dwarf-planet. Here is how it compares to Earth's and Jupiter's planetary systems. We are comparing dimensions here, the difference is even more stark when translated to masses (volume is proportional to radius^3).
